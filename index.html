<p>I am currently enrolled as a junior in two schools! My primary high school is <a href="summitprep.summitps.org">Summit Preparatory High School</a>, located in Redwood City, CA.
 My second high school is not a brick and mortar school, as can be inferred by its name, <a href="ohs.stanford.edu">Stanford Online High School</a>, or formerly known as Stanford's Education Program for Gifted Youth.
Both schools are relatively new, but are both top ranked! Summit Preparatory has consistently been mentioned in countless articles for its innovative design and support from tycoons like the Zuckerbergs. 
Though it is only in it's tenth year, Stanford Online High School has been ranked the #3 private high school in America by the reputable <a href="k12.niche.com">k12.niche.com</a>.
Thus, I have immense school pride for both (go huskies and pixels!)
<br> <br>Ever since I could be carried as a child, I have been priviledged to see the world with my family.
I have travelled to countries like Mexico, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Cambodia, and Italy.</p>

        <h3>hobbies & whatnot</h3>
        <p>In addition to my academics, I enjoy doing several things outside of school. Right after school I typically go to volleyball! 
        In the past I had played libero, but this year I'm an outside hitter and play all around. Also in pursuit of my passion,
        attend class in AP sciences afterwards (as mentioned with Stanford OHS). I also have had experience in molecular biological research,
        so I spend much time learning about it. In the future, I hope to pursue a career where I can apply these interests!</p>
