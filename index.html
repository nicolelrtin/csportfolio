<p>I am currently enrolled as a junior in two schools! My primary high school is <a href="summitprep.summitps.org">Summit Preparatory High School</a>, located in Redwood City, CA.
 My second high school is not your brick and mortar school, as can be inferred by its name, <a href="ohs.stanford.edu">Stanford Online High School</a>, or formerly known as Stanford's Education Program for Gifted Youth.
Both schools are relatively new, but are both top ranked! Summit Preparatory has consistently been mentioned in countless articles for its innovative design and support from tycoons like the Zuckerbergs. 
Though it is only in it's tenth year, Stanford Online High School has been ranked the #3 private high school in America by the reputable <a href="k12.niche.com">k12.niche.com</a>.
Thus, I have immense school pride for both (go huskies and pixels!)
<br> <br>Ever since I could be carried as a child, I have been priviledged to see the world with my family.
I have travelled to countries like Mexico, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Cambodia, and Italy.</p>
