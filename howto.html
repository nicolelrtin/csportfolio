<h1>how to create a webpage!</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">this module illustrates how the <a href="hardware.html">hardware</a> page was constructed.
<br> use the subnavigation bar to find tutorials on specific aspects of the page. enjoy! &#9786 </p>

<h2 id="lay">metadata</h2>
<div class="laycontainer">
    <!--how to make the contents fill same % of space-->
    <p style="width: 40%;">Before starting on your coding, the first thing any programmer must do with html is insert the <b>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</b> tag.  
    This doctype tag tells the computer what kind of document to expect (the <i>type</i> of document), and sometimes the version of the html. 
    Following this are standard "head" elements that defines metadata, which is not displayed in the html itself. 
    The fifth line writes the title of the page, which will show on the tab, but again, not on the display. 
    The sixth and seventh lines link the html to other lines of code; the <b>&lt;script&gt;</b> tag links JavaScript coding (from another file) to this so it may appear in the webpage. 
    Similarly, the succeeding line connects the file with written CSS to the html. 
    The figure on the (left/right) shows the code used in the <a href="hardware.html">hardware page</a>!

<div class="navbars">
    
<h2 id="main">main navigation bar</h2>
<div class="maincontainer">
<!--<img src="images/navbar-2.png"-->
<!--     alt="navigation bar html" />-->
     <p style="width: 45%;">To set the foundation of the page, I repeated the same step for every tab of this website (by copying and pasting, so the results are consistent).
     The navigation bar is simply a directory using a list of links to redirect the user to different features of the webpage.
     First, I created a list using an unordered list ( <b>&lt;ul&gt;</b> ) and link ( <b>&lt;a href&gt;</b> ) tags. 
     Then, using CSS, I simply added fonts, colors, and structure for it to appear the way it is now. 
     Again, these elements are copied and pasted each page for consistency. 
     On the left is an image of the navigation bar without any of the CSS styling. 
     This can give you an idea of how the html looks alone. 
     On the right is an image of the CSS code that was added for it to appear the way it is now.</p>

<h2 id="sub">subnavigation bar</h2>
<div class="subcontainer">
    <table>
    <tr>
   <td>
    <p style="width: 80%;">In addition to the main navigation bar, I created a second, smalller menu to simplify navigation of the website.
    Because there are so many components of building a website, users may seek only to learn about one hardware component.
    Therefore, I made the menu interactive in that the page will automatically scroll to a certain subsection when clicked (the same thing has been applied to this page). 
    Creation of this component was much more complex than the main navigation bar. 
    The foundation was set by creating an unordered list and copying the format of the aforementioned. 
    The primary difference in forming this bar was simply that the font size was reduced and list items were not linked. 
    <br>Animating this menu was more complex; which is why we could not simply link each section in the menu. 
    Because I wanted to link the menu items to sections on the same page, we used id tags ( written as <b>&lt;id=&quot;#&quot;&gt;</b> ) to locate each item (instead of links).
    Each list item was given its own id tag, and then each h2 element was given a pertinent id tag. 
    (Meticulous, yes, but necessary!)
    In a JavaScript file I could instruct the html to scroll to the h2 element tag when an initial tag was clicked. 
    To animate it, I simply modified researched syntax to operate in my own page.
    The model I used was simply written as → </p>
    </td>
    <td>
<div>
<!--style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 26, 0.3);-->
<!--            display: inline-block;-->
<!--            vertical-align: middle;" -->
    
    
    <pre> <!--style="width: 15%;"--> 
$("#varButton").click(function() {
  $('html, body').animate({
    scrollTop: $("#var").offset().top
  }, 2700);
});

</pre></div></td>
    </tr>

<tr><br>

    <td>
    <p style="width: 80%;">Where <b>&lt;var&gt;</b> is written, I inserted my own id tags.
    Specifically, the first line tells the computer that the signal is when the id (labelled by the "#") is clicked, it should follow the succeeding functions. 
    The next two lines explains that the page should be animated and scroll to the "#var" element, and the last line dictates the speed of the scroll.
    I repeated these lines for every menu item, simply changing the id tags for each one.
    The most complex part of this process was ensuring there were no errors and troubleshooting. 
    In jQuery, one error can lead to a cascading failure and page will be erroneous. 
    This is why it is imperative that there are no syntax errors and that there are no 
    As mentioned when creating the foundation of the whole page, I linked jQuery script to my html (link gathered from external resources). 
    At the bottom of the page, before the closing body tag, I added the script tag that links <i>my</i> javascript code to the html file. </p>

<h2 id="head">headings</h2>
    <div class="headcontainer">
<p style="width: 40%;">
    Creating headings is likely one of the simplest parts of designing any webpage. 
    Heading elements are preexistent in html, so all a coder needs to do is determine what size heading he/she would prefer. 
    These elements are written as <b>&lt;h1&gt;</b>, and the number indicates what kind of heading. 
    For example, h1 represents the main heading, while h2 can be a subheading, and h3 a sub-sub heading. 
    Though these elements can come with a presetting, it can be modified to taste in CSS. 
    I standardized the webpage so the default font of the webpage would be helvetica nue in white and would be center aligned (lines 63-65). 
    This reduced the amount of coding I had to specify for the heading, so all I added were stylistic touches and padding.
</p>

     style="width: 45%;"/>

</div>

<h2 id="text">text and images</h2>
<div class="textcontainer">
    <p style="width: 46%;">
        Similar to headings, text and images possess element tags that are straightforward means to add content to a webpage.
        Body text, or paragraphs, are represented as simply <b>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</b>, with the content written inbetween the sets. 
        There are not many additions to text alone, other than the fact that to "return", the <b>&lt;br&gt;</b> (break tag) needs to be utilized. 
        <br>Image tags are self closing (meaning they can fit within one bracket), but they require slightly more information. 
        It isn't enough to simply create an image tag; the html does not know what image to display! 
        At bare minimum, the src attribute needs to be added. 
        This tells the html <i>where</i> to find the image you want to include. 
        To secure the files, it is recommended that images are saved and uploaded to an image folder that the html can refer to. 
        If the image source is from the internet, the tag should look like <b>&lt;img src=&quot;www.google.com&quot;/&gt; </b>. 
        An image uploaded to a folder should resemble <b>&lt;img src=&quot;images/picture.jpg&quot;/&gt; </b>. 
        The second tag has two main components to understand. 
        Before the forward slash is the <i>name of the folder</i>, on the other side is the <i>file name</i>. 
        Tip: Rename your files so it is easier to locate them in the future and also easier to write into your code! 
        Additionally, another attribute to add is <b>&lt;alt&gt;</b> . 
        Although not necessary, use of this attribute is highly advised. 
        If, for any reason, an image does not load, this attribute will alternatively display this sample of text (usually concisely describing the image). 
        This can also be added into the image tag without any brackets. 
        Building off the previous examples, the code should now look like <b>&lt;img src=&quot;images/picture.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;examplar picture&quot;/&gt;</b> .
        </p>
        
        <img src="images/content.png"
         alt="motherboard html" />
         
        <p>To place these two elements along the same horizontal row, a few steps were taken.
        <br><b>1. </b>A <b>&lt;div&gt;</b> was placed around the elements, and then designated a class. 
        In the CSS, the class simply needs <b>display: inline-block;</b> within the brackets. 
        <br><b>2. </b>Inside each image and paragraph tag, I styled the width to a certain percent so the text and image would only fill a small percent of the page. 
        Make sure the sum of the percents equates to a percentage that is less than 100%!
        <br>This step requires a lot of trial and error, and may not be consistent for <i>each</i> image or text.
    </p>

<h2 id="aes">aesthetic/design</h2>
<div class="aescontainer">
    <p style="width:50%;">
        <b>BACKGROUND IMAGE:</b> In the body selector of the CSS, I added a background property. 
        Instead of choosing a color, I entered <b>url( )</b> and <b>background-size: cover;</b> . 
        This image background can be seen on all modules so the website as a whole has fluidity and cohesion.
